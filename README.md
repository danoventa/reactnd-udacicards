# Udacity's Udacicards Project
This is a react native project, udacicards, or Udacity's nanodegree program. The application is a flashcard quizzing app, that allows you to create new decks, add cards to them, and quiz yourself. 

The questions are honorsystem based. You create your flashcards, and view the question. You're able to toggle between questions and answers. If you got it correct, go ahead and hit the correct button. Otherwise, hit incorrect, and move on to the next one! Once you're done, you'll be given your score and be allowed to run the quiz again, or go back to the deck. 
## Setup

Clone this repo into your local directory with
> git clone https://github.com/danoventa/reactnd-udacicards.git

change into the newly created directory
> cd reactnd-udacicards


The app can be run with expo through either yarn, or npm. 

With yarn:
> yarn install && yarn start

With Npm
> npm install && npm start

The command line should display a QR code, if you've already installed expo, and set up your xcode / android studio environment, then you can just hit the appropriate key, or skan the qr code on the expo app of your device. 

I've tested with iOS only, you can check it out in the simulator by hitting ```i``` in the terminal.
